## [Level 10 -> Level 11](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit11.html)

That level is quite simple, just decode file:

```
base64 -d data.txt
```

## [Level 11 -> Level 12](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit12.html)

To get password just type:

```
cat data.txt
```

and decode result. I was using [rot13.com/](https://rot13.com/). Rot13 is simple cipher, you can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13)
