## [Level 0 -> Level 1](https://overthewire.org/wargames/krypton/krypton0.html)

Just simple base64 decode

```
echo S1JZUFRPTklTR1JFQVQ= | base64 -d
```

password: KRYPTONISGREAT


## [Level 1 -> Level 2](hhttps://overthewire.org/wargames/krypton/krypton1.html)

Use rot13.com to get password.

password: LEVEL TWO PASSWORD ROTTEN

## [Level 2 -> Level 3](https://overthewire.org/wargames/krypton/krypton2.html)

There is simple substitution cipher. For example this kind of cipher for encryption for 'A' substitute 'X' etc. So we need to get substitution table. Following python code will generate payload to encryption: 

```
import string

characters = [string.ascii_letters, string.digits]
x = []
for item in characters:
    for i in item:
        x.append(i)

print(''.join(x))
```

save it as "gen.py" then run

```
python gen.py >> data.txt
```

after that encryt file "data.txt". After all I create this script: 

```
ciphertext = 'MNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKL'
plaintext = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789'

code = {}

for c,p in zip(ciphertext, plaintext):
    code[c] = p

text_to_decode = 'OMQEMDUEQMEK'

pt = []
for i in text_to_decode:
    pt.append(code[i])

print(''.join(pt))
```

with this code I obtain password to next level. 

password: CAESARISEASY

## [Level 3 -> Level 4](https://overthewire.org/wargames/krypton/krypton3.html)

This level was quite challenging. I was using some online tools to cryptanalysis, and without data from these tools I tried to guess passwords. It took me a while, but I did it!

password: WELL DONE THE LEVEL PASSWROD IS BRUTE

## [Level 4 -> Level 5](https://overthewire.org/wargames/krypton/krypton4.html)

To restore password used to encrytion I used [vigenere-solver](https://www.guballa.de/vigenere-solver).

![vigenere](assets/krypton/4/vigenere.png)

Restored password is: frekey. With this password I can decrypt the password. I do this with [that page](https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher).

password: CLEARTEXT

## [Level 5 -> Level 6](https://overthewire.org/wargames/krypton/krypton5.html)

To crack passwords I used the same tools as in the previous level.

![password](assets/krypton/5/pass.png)

You need to remove space.

password: RANDOM

## [Level 6 -> Level 7](https://overthewire.org/wargames/krypton/krypton6.html)

One time pad ciphers are safe when the key is truly random. LSFR as a random bit stream generator isn't a good idea because output of this "device" if circular - that means not safe. To test this long file if required, to file that meet this requirement i use following command:

```
python -c "print('B'*1024)" > foo
```

then I encrypt foo file. 

```
cd /tmp/
mkdir piotr
cd piotr
ln -s /krypton/krypton6/keyfile.dat
python -c "print('A'*1024)" > foo
/krypton/krypton6/encrypt6 foo bar
cat bar

```

After all to obtain a password I use dcode.fr online tool, as a password I used this sequance EICTDGYIYZKTHNSIRFXYCPFUEOCKRN which is repeated one by one. 

password: LFSRISNOTRANDOM
