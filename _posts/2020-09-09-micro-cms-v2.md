# Flag 0

### Hints:
* Regular users can only see public pages
* Getting admin access might require a more perfect union
* Knowing the password is cool, but there are other approaches that might be easier


I go to the login page, test some popular logins and passwords, but nothing works. Then I type an apostrophe for the username that causes this error:

![SQL query error](/assets/micro-cms-v2/flag0/sql_error.png)

I am creating the following load for the bypass login form:
```
username: admin' union select 'test' as password #
password: test
```

![Admin home page](/assets/micro-cms-v2/flag0/pv_page.png)

Go to private page and read flag:

![Flag](/assets/micro-cms-v2/flag0/flag.png)

# Flag 1

### Hints:
* What actions could you perform as a regular user on the last level, which you can't now?
* Just because request fails with one method doesn't mean it will fail with a different method
* Different requests often have different required authorization

In Micro-CMS v1 regular user can edit page. Micro-CMS v2 require admin privileges. Change request type to get flag:

![Orginal request](/assets/micro-cms-v2/flag1/orginal)request.png)

Change, and send. In response is flag:
![Flag](/assets/micro-cms-v2/flag1/flag.png)

# Flag 2

### Hints:
* Credentials are secret, flags are secret. Coincidence? 

Use sql injection to fetch data from database. Login form is vulnerable. I use sqlmap:
```
sqlmap -u http://35.190.155.168/xxxxxxx/login --data "username=test&password=test" --dump
```

![Credentials](/assets/micro-cms-v2/flag2/credentials.png)

Login with those credentials, and read flag:

![Flag](/assets/micro-cms-v2/flag2/flag.png)
