## Initial page

![Initial page](/assets/{{ page.title | downcase | replace: ' ','-'}}/init.png) 

There is two posts, and link to new post creation page. Initially there isn't anything interesting.

* * *

## Flag 0

#### Hints:

* Try creating a new page
* How are pages indexed?
* Look at the sequence of IDs
* If the front door doesn't open, try the window
* In what ways can you retrieve page contents?

First thing I do was creating new page:

![New post](/assets/{{ page.title | downcase | replace: ' ','-'}}/flag0/new_post.png)

Note id of that page is 10. Interesting huh? Let's check out other posts ids.

```html
		<ul>
<li><a href="page/1">Testing</a></li>
<li><a href="page/2">Markdown Test</a></li>
<li><a href="page/10">test</a></li>
		</ul>
```

Those ids are interesting, why id of new page isn't 3? Maybe somwere between 2 and 10 something is hidden? Unfortunately id enumeration didn't give anthing interesting. Another place where id of post appears in url is edit page. Maybe now hidden post will be founded? 

![Edit](/assets/{{ page.title | downcase | replace: ' ','-'}}/flag0/edit_post.png) 

I enumerated all ids between 2 and 10 by hand and found flag:

![Edit](/assets/{{ page.title | downcase | replace: ' ','-'}}/flag0/flag.png)

## Flag 1

#### Hints

* Make sure you tamper with every input
* Have you tested for the usual culprits? XSS, SQL injection, path injection
* Bugs often occur when an input should always be one type and turns out to be another
* Remember, form submissions aren't the only inputs that come from browsers

I already test almost all inputs, except id parameter in URL. After adding apostrophe to id flag is shown up:

![Edit](/assets/{{ page.title | downcase | replace: ' ','-'}}/flag1/flag.png) 

* * *

## Flag 2

#### Hints

* Sometimes a given input will affect more than one page
* The bug you are looking for doesn't exist in the most obvious place this input is shown

Post title appear on more than one page. So I try to play with that input, and this:

![Edit](/assets/{{ page.title | downcase | replace: ' ','-'}}/flag2/xss.png) 

produces that page:

![Edit](/assets/{{ page.title | downcase | replace: ' ','-'}}/flag2/xss_page.png) 

and that produce an XSS error on main page, flag is shown up:

![Edit](/assets/{{ page.title | downcase | replace: ' ','-'}}/flag2/flag.png) 

* * *

## Flag 3

#### Hints:

* Script tags are great, but what other options do you have?

So html tag "script" is disallowed, but there is still way to execute JavaScript code. It is possible by using img tag in that way:

```html
<img src=file_that_do_not_exist onerror=any_js_code>
```
In that case browser will try to fetch image. That resource do not exist so it will cause an error and browser will execute js code from onerror attribute.

Let's try it in practice, create: 

![](/assets/{{ page.title | downcase | replace: ' ','-'}}/flag3/xss.png)

and seve this page. Then go to this page, 

![](/assets/{{ page.title | downcase | replace: ' ','-'}}/flag3/result.png)

alert box is successfully displayed. Flag is exposed in page source code.

![](/assets/{{ page.title | downcase | replace: ' ','-'}}/flag3/flag.png)
