### Initial page

![](/assets/{{ page.title | downcase | replace: ' ','-'}}/init.png)



## Flag 3

### Hints:

* Script tags are great, but what other options do you have?

So html tag "script" is disallowed, but there is still way to execute JavaScript code. It is possible by using img tag in that way:

```html
<img src=file_that_do_not_exist onerror=any_js_code>
```
In that case browser will try to fetch image. That resource do not exist so it will cause an error and browser will execute js code from onerror attribute.

Let's try it in practice, create: 

![](/assets/{{ page.title | downcase | replace: ' ','-'}}/flag3/xss.png)

and seve this page. Then go to this page, 

![](/assets/{{ page.title | downcase | replace: ' ','-'}}/flag3/result.png)

alert box is successfully displayed. Flag is exposed in page source code.
