I found an interesting page [https://overthewire.org](https://overthewire.org/wargames/). There are few games, something like a ctf challenge. I decide to have some fun with it. As a starting point I choose the bandit game, so let's begin!

## [Level 0](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html)

To connect with remote server I used this command:

```
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

## [Level 0 -> Level 1](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit1.html)

From description I obtain password and file name where is password to next level respectively it is: bandit0 and readme. After successfully logging in read readme file using cat:

```
cat readme
```

password: boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1

## [Level 1 -> Level 2](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit2.html)

Connect to the server using ssh and password from the previous level. File called '-' is in the home directory, you should already be in this location. To get password to next level use: 

```
cd ~ # Move to home direcotry.
cat ./- # Dot and backslash is reqired to point out file in current direcotry.
```

## [Level 2 -> Level 3](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit3.html)

Password to the next level is in file "spaces in this filename". I am using zsh and all spaces were auto escaped. I don't think it will be too easy in another terminal, but at all you must only escape spaces:

```
cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename
```

password: UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK

## [Level 3 -> Level 4](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit3.html)

The major problem to solve is that the file where the password is located is hidden. If you go to inhere directory type 'ls' no data will be returned. But if you use '-a' switch then you will get information about all files in that path. 

```
cd inhere/
cat .hidden 
```

password: pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB

## [Level 4 -> Level 5](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit4.html)

After successful login in go to inhere directory, and try to find a human-readable file. To do this use the command file. To get password just type inhere directory:

```
cat ./-file05

```

password: koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh

## [Level 5 -> Level 6](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit5.html)

After successful login in go to inhere directory, and try to find a human-readable file. To do this use the command file. To get password just type inhere directory:

```
cat ./-file05

```
