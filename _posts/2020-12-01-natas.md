![Message](assets/natas/1/message.png)

So the password is in the comment tag on the page. So we need just to view page source code without right clicking. In firefox it can be done with the following shortcut: [right ctrl] + u.

![Message](assets/natas/2/message.png)

Interesting part:

![File](assets/natas/2/interes.png)

So let's check if it is possible to view content of files directory. It is possible and there are some files, pixel files we have already seen but what is in users.txt file.

Message:
![Message](assets/natas/3/message.png)

There is really nothing!

![Page source code](assets/natas/3/source_code.png)

So I check robots.txt file, content:

![Robots](assets/natas/3/robots.png)

So s3cr3t/ is disallowed to robots, it is interesting what is there:

![Direcotry content](assets/natas/3/direcotry_content.png)

And the password is in users.txt file.

![Message](assets/natas/4/message.png)

So we must trick the system we enter the page from natas5. So let fire up burp. 

![Request headers](assets/natas/4/orginal_referer.png)

Referrer value must be changed to:

```
http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/
```

Username: natas5
Lab URL: http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/

![Message](assets/natas/5/message.png)

So we must be logged in. I check some pages like login, sign in etc. And didn't find anything. I carefully check request, and find cookie logged in:

![Request](assets/natas/5/request.png)

So change what will happen if we set 1 in logged in cookie. Bingo! Password has been found. 

![Password](assets/natas/5/password.png)

# ## [Level 5 -> Level 6](https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/natas6.html)

Username: natas6
Lab URL: http://natas6.natas.labs.overthewire.org/

In initial page is these form:

![Message](assets/natas/6/message.png)

and nothing more, I checked source code as allways of course. So an interesting button is called "View source code". Look what is there:

![Source code](assets/natas/6/code.png)

I copy only the interesting part of code. So we need to know the value of the "secret" variable. This variable is in included file "includes/secret.inc" so let's check this file, go to http://natas6.natas.labs.overthewire.org/includes/secret.inc this page look as a blank page, but like always check the source, and bingo! Secret value has been found!

# ## [Level 6 -> Level 7](https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/natas7.html)

Username: natas7
Lab URL: http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/

In page source code is an hint:

![Page](assets/natas/7/page_interesing_part.png)

So we exactly know where passwords are located. We must only read this file. It can be done in this way:

```
http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=/etc/natas_webpass/natas8
```

More about this bug you can read [here](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Local_File_Inclusion)

# ## [Level 7 -> Level 8](https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/natas8.html)

Username: natas8
Lab URL: http://natas8.natas.labs.overthewire.org/

![Page](assets/natas/8/page.png)

As in level level 5 let's check "view source code". 

![Source code](assets/natas/8/source_code.png)

So we have the value of the encoded secret, we only need to get its original value. We need to first reverse hex2bin, then strrev and finally base64 encoding, it can be done by following code:

```
<?php
$encodedSecret = "3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362";

function decodeSecret($secret) {
    return base64_decode(strrev(pack('H*', $secret)));
}

print(decodeSecret($encodedSecret));
?php>
# Print: oubWYf2kBq
```

After submitting decoded value I get password to the next level.

# ## [Level 8 -> Level 9](https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/natas9.html)

Username: natas9
Lab URL: http://natas9.natas.labs.overthewire.org/

![Page](assets/natas/9/page.png)

As in previous level: 

![Code](assets/natas/9/code.png)

So if "needle" exist in request then value from request is assigned to variable, if this value is not empty string execute following code: 

```
passthru("grep -i $key dictionary.txt");
```

In this case crucial thing is good understanding of [passthru function](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.passthru.php). More about this type of bug you can read [here](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Command_Injection).

You can get password by submitting following query: 

```
testtttt; cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10
```

Why it works you must understand by your own.

# ## [Level 9 -> Level 10](https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/natas10.html)

Username: natas10
Lab URL: http://natas10.natas.labs.overthewire.org/

This level is very similar to previous, but now not all characters are allowed:

![Code](assets/natas/10/code.png)

Illegal are following characters: 

```
&
|
;
```

In that case we can't use the previous payload because it wouldn't work. Value to server is passed via url - needle param. So it will by my entry point. We can use new line character '\n' didn't work, I test few encoding of this character and this works:

```
http://natas10.natas.labs.overthewire.org/?needle=%0Acat%20/etc/natas_webpass/natas11
```
