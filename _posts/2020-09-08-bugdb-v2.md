#### Hints:
* What has changed since last version?
* What do the queries tell you?
* Have you tried a mutation?

Like in [BugBD v1](/bugdb-v1) I start with printing all queries:

That is a new item (compared to the last version). More about mutations read [here](https://shopify.dev/concepts/graphql/mutations). 

Let's take a closer look at the stored data.

So there are two users - admin and victim, but only admin entry is visible in the allBugs collection. Maybe the second antry is private and not visible? As it is mentioned in hints, we should try mutation. After reading a few articles about GraphQL I wrote and run following code:

```
mutation{
  modifyBug(id:2,private:false){
    ok
  }
}
```

After all flag is available:
